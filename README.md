<h2>Top priority at the moment?:</h2> 
<p>Learning how to build an app by looking at example code or watching tutorials such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAbQgLGKd3Y&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBsvRxJJOzG4r4k_zLKrnxl">this one</a><br><br>
Watching all the tutorials adds up to roughly 11.2 hours but I'm pretty sure there are a lot of things that won't help us or that we need to know but isn't in the tutorial.  So hopefully get started on it asap 15 days from today (3/5) until the project's part 2 is due.<br><br>
Summarizing what we need for part 2, we need walk throughs with pictures of a use-case scenario.  Explain design decisions.  A presentation version of the write-up.  Explain our code and clear instructions on how to get it running.<br><br></p>

<h2>Upcoming due dates for the project</h2>

<h3>Project Part 2 -DUE FRI, Mar 20</h3>
Details:
 <ul>
  <li>A write-up of your design (~5 pages of text, plus images). This should include a detailed walk-through, including screenshots, of a typical use-case scenario. You should also explain your design decisions.</li>
  <li>A presentation (~ 5min) that does essentially the same thing: explain your design decisions and present a walk-through. Both members of your team should speak. Please keep in mind the feedback I gave you on your first presentation. Your first presentation was supposed to persuade the audience that your app was a great idea. Your second presentation should explain how your app works. </li>
  <li>Your code, and clear, unambiguous instructions on how to get it running. For example, if it only works on a particular emulator, let me know. Note that I'm not grading you on your code - but I will use it to make sure that your write-up and presentation honestly describe what you've done! </li>
 </ul>
