<h2>Top priority at the moment?:</h2> 
<p>Learning how to build an app by looking at example code or watching tutorials such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAbQgLGKd3Y&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBsvRxJJOzG4r4k_zLKrnxl">this one</a><br><br>
Watching all the tutorials adds up to roughly 11.2 hours but I'm pretty sure there are a lot of things that won't help us or that we need to know but isn't in the tutorial.  So hopefully get started on it asap 15 days from today (3/5) until the project's part 2 is due.<br><br></p>
