<h2>Top priority at the moment?:</h2> 
<p>FINISHING THE APP!!! YEEEAA<br><br>Learning how to build an app by looking at example code or watching tutorials such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAbQgLGKd3Y&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBsvRxJJOzG4r4k_zLKrnxl">this one</a><br><br>
Watching all the tutorials adds up to roughly 11.2 hours but I'm pretty sure there are a lot of things that won't help us or that we need to know but isn't in the tutorial.  So hopefully get started on it asap 15 days from today (3/5) until the project's part 2 is due.</p>

<h2>Upcoming due dates for the project</h2>

<h3>Project Part 2 -DUE FRI, Mar 20</h3>
Details:
 <ul>
  <li>A write-up of your design (~5 pages of text, plus images). This should include a detailed walk-through, including screenshots, of a typical use-case scenario. You should also explain your design decisions.</li>
  <li>A presentation (~ 5min) that does essentially the same thing: explain your design decisions and present a walk-through. Both members of your team should speak. Please keep in mind the feedback I gave you on your first presentation. Your first presentation was supposed to persuade the audience that your app was a great idea. Your second presentation should explain how your app works. </li>
  <li>Your code, and clear, unambiguous instructions on how to get it running. For example, if it only works on a particular emulator, let me know. Note that I'm not grading you on your code - but I will use it to make sure that your write-up and presentation honestly describe what you've done! </li>
 </ul>


<h3>Project Part 3 -DUE FRI, Apr 24</h3>
Details:
 <ul>
  <li>Something to do with user testing.</li>
 </ul>

 
<h3>Final FULL Project -DUE FRI, May 8</h3>
Details:
 <ul>
  <li>A cohesive project document (~10 pages). You will probably be able to reuse a lot of what you have already written, but please don't just slap the three parts together end to end! The final document should flow from beginning to conclusion, and incorporate everything you have learned this semester. If you have changed your project idea or design, the document should describe the new idea/design. If you have implemented more features, the document should describe them. If you have designed features, but not implemented them yet, provide mock-ups of how they should look and behave. You should also describe your future plans for your project,  based in part on feedback from your fellow students and from me (summarize the feedback, but don't provide the raw data).</li>
  <li>A ~5 minute video pitching your project. You will probably have to make this from scratch. Imagine you are presenting to a room full of potential investors. You will need to a) describe your idea, b) convince the audience that it is a great idea, c) describe your target market and revenue stream(s), d) show what you've done so far and e) say what you want to do next. Your presentation style should be both professional and enthusiastic. It should actually be hard to fit it all into five minutes, but do your best!
